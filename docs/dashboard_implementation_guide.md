## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
PROWORKFLOW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PROWORKFLOW_USERNAME=your_username_here  
PROWORKFLOW_PASSWORD=your_password_here
PORT=3000
```

### Dependencies (package.json)
```json
{
  "name": "proworkflow-dashboard",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "axios": "^1.6.0", 
    "dotenv": "^16.3.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Local Development
1. Clone/download project files
2. Create `.env` file with credentials
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment (Heroku)
1. Set environment variables in Heroku config
2. Ensure `package.json` has correct start script
3. Deploy via Git or Heroku CLI
4. Test endpoints: `/health`, `/api/test`

## Key Features Implemented

### Dashboard Functionality
- [x] Project list with team filtering
- [x] Manager-based filtering and sorting
- [x] Project health metrics (idle time, due dates)
- [x] Expandable task lists per project
- [x] Task assignment display
- [x] Real-time statistics

### API Integration
- [x] ProWorkflow REST API connection
- [x] Project data retrieval
- [x] Task details with assignments
- [x] Contact/assignment mapping
- [x] Error handling and fallbacks

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "No data was loaded"
**Symptoms**: Dashboard shows loading but no projects appear
**Diagnosis**:
1. Check server logs for API errors
2. Verify `.env` credentials are correct
3. Test `/health` and `/api/test` endpoints

**Solutions**:
- Verify API credentials in ProWorkflow admin
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure team manager IDs are correct

### Issue: "Task titles showing as 'Untitled Task'"
**Symptoms**: Assignments work but task names don't appear
**Root Cause**: Using wrong field name for task title
**Solution**: Ensure code uses `task.name` not `task.title`

### Issue: "All tasks show 'Unassigned'"
**Symptoms**: Task titles work but no assignments appear
**Root Cause**: Wrong assignment data source
**Solution**: Use `taskDetails.contacts` array from individual task calls

### Issue: "Server crashes on project expansion"
**Symptoms**: Dashboard loads but crashes when expanding projects
**Root Cause**: Unhandled API errors or rate limiting
**Solutions**:
- Add try/catch around all API calls
- Limit concurrent requests (max 10 tasks)
- Add delays between API calls if needed

### Issue: "Tasks load but assignments are empty"
**Symptoms**: Task names appear but assignments always "Unassigned"
**Root Cause**: Many tasks genuinely have no assignments
**Verification**: Check individual tasks in ProWorkflow - many tasks are unassigned

## Performance Considerations

### API Rate Limiting
- Limit concurrent task calls to 10 per project
- Consider implementing request queuing for large projects
- Cache responses when possible

### Frontend Performance
- Use loading states during API calls
- Implement virtual scrolling for large project lists
- Debounce filter/sort operations

### Server Performance  
- Add response caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement request logging for debugging
- Use compression middleware for production

## Security Notes

### API Credentials
- Store in environment variables, never in code
- Use separate credentials for different environments
- Regularly rotate API keys

### Server Security
- Enable CORS for production domains only
- Add request logging and monitoring
- Implement API request limits

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Server status and config verification
- `GET /api/test` - ProWorkflow API connectivity test
- `GET /api/rest/test-task-contacts/:id` - Individual task testing

### Debug Logging
Enable debug mode in dashboard to see:
- API request/response details
- Field mapping results  
- Assignment extraction process

### Server Logs
Key log patterns to watch for:
```
✅ API Success: /projects - Status: 200
✅ Found 1 tasks with assignments
❌ API Error: /tasks/123 - 404 Not Found
```

## Common Error Patterns

### Authentication Errors (401)
- Check API key validity
- Verify username/password combination
- Ensure credentials match ProWorkflow account

### Not Found Errors (404)
- Task/project may have been deleted
- Check ID formatting (numbers only)
- Verify endpoint URLs are correct

### Empty Data Responses
- Check team manager ID filtering
- Verify project has tasks
- Confirm task has assignments in ProWorkflow

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Add real-time updates via webhooks
- Implement user authentication
- Add project creation/editing capabilities
- Export functionality for reports
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

### API Extensions
- Integrate time tracking data
- Add budget/billing information  
- Include project attachments/files
- Support for custom fields

## Support Resources

### ProWorkflow Documentation
- API Reference: https://api.proworkflow.net
- Support Portal: ProWorkflow help system
- API Rate Limits: Check ProWorkflow documentation

### Development Tools
- ProWorkflow API Tester (built-in to ProWorkflow)
- Postman collection for API testing
- Browser developer tools for frontend debugging

## Version History

### v1.0 (Current)
- Basic project dashboard
- Task assignment display
- Team filtering
- Manager-based sorting
- Expandable task lists

### Known Issues
- Limited to 10 tasks per project (performance)
- No real-time updates (requires refresh)
- Basic error handling (could be more user-friendly)

### Planned Updates
- Enhanced error messaging
- Performance optimizations
- Additional filtering options
- Export capabilities
